**Learning:** The calculator web app was missing `*:focus-visible` styles, making keyboard navigation difficult. The dark theme background with light interactive elements requires a specific focus color (`var(--accent)`) to ensure visibility on both dark shell and light display areas.
**Action:** Always verify `*:focus-visible` is present in global CSS for web apps, especially those with custom themes. Test with keyboard navigation (Tab) to ensure the focus ring contrasts well with all backgrounds.
