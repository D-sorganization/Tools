INSTRUCTIONS FOR INTERPRETING PACKED PROJECT FILES
==================================================

1. File Format
   The packed file is a plain text file containing multiple source files, each delimited by special markers. The folder structure and file names are preserved.

2. Delimiters
   - Each file block starts with:
     %%%%%% START FILE: relative/path/to/file.ext %%%%%%
   - Each file block ends with:
     %%%%%% END FILE: relative/path/to/file.ext %%%%%%
   - The relative path is from the original packed folder.

3. Header and Footer
   - The file begins with metadata lines (e.g., source folder, pack time, exclusions).
   - The file ends with:
     %%%%%% END OF PACKED PROJECT %%%%%%

4. How to Extract Files
   - Read the packed file as text.
   - For each START FILE delimiter, extract the file path.
   - Collect all text until the corresponding END FILE delimiter.
   - Save the collected text as the file content, using the extracted path to reconstruct the folder structure.

5. Notes
   - If a file block contains the line:
     ****** ERROR: Could not read file content. Error: ... ******
     treat this as a placeholder for a file that could not be packed.
   - Ignore the metadata and footer lines for file extraction.

6. Example
   %%%%%% START FILE: src/main.py %%%%%%
   print("Hello, world!")
   %%%%%% END FILE: src/main.py %%%%%%

   This block should be saved as src/main.py with the given content.
