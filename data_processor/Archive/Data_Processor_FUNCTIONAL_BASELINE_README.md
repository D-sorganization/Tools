# Data Processor Functional Baseline - 2025-07-29

## Overview
This is a restored version of the Data Processor application from commit `4730b81` (2025-07-29) - the last known working state before troubleshooting began on 2025-07-30.

## File Details
- **Filename**: `Data_Processor_FUNCTIONAL_BASELINE_2025-07-29.py`
- **Original Commit**: 4730b81 - "Data Processor save current."
- **Date**: July 29, 2025
- **Size**: ~218KB

## Known Working Features
This baseline version should have:
- ✅ Basic CSV file processing
- ✅ Signal selection and filtering
- ✅ Data export (CSV, Excel, MAT formats)
- ✅ Plotting functionality
- ✅ Time trimming and resampling
- ✅ Integration and differentiation
- ✅ Custom variables
- ✅ Plot appearance customization
- ✅ Trendline analysis

## Why This Baseline Was Created
During troubleshooting on 2025-07-30, several issues emerged:
1. Plotting signals not displaying correctly
2. Processing pipeline showing both success and failure messages
3. Export functionality problems
4. Deprecated pandas resampling warnings

This baseline provides a clean starting point that was functional before these issues appeared.

## Usage Instructions
1. **To test the baseline**: Run this file directly to verify functionality
2. **To restore functionality**: Compare this baseline with current version to identify what broke
3. **To continue development**: Use this as a stable foundation for new features

## Git Information
- **Restored from commit**: 4730b81
- **Command used**: `git show 4730b81:data_processor/Data_Processor_r0.py > Data_Processor_FUNCTIONAL_BASELINE_2025-07-29.py`
- **Restoration date**: July 30, 2025

## Next Steps
1. Test this baseline version to confirm it works as expected
2. Compare with current `Data_Processor_r0.py` to identify breaking changes
3. Apply fixes incrementally while maintaining functionality
