# Data Processor - Plotting Performance Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to address plotting system freezing and slow performance with large datasets.

## üöÄ Key Performance Improvements

### 1. Optimized File Loading System
- **Smart Caching Strategy**: Efficient memory management with automatic cache clearing
- **Multi-Encoding Support**: Robust file reading with fallback encoding detection
- **Large File Optimization**: Automatic sampling for files >50MB to prevent UI freezing
- **Batch Processing**: Signal checkbox creation in small batches to maintain UI responsiveness

### 2. Asynchronous Operations
- **Delayed Plot Updates**: Non-blocking plot generation using `after()` scheduling
- **Progressive UI Updates**: Status indicators and progress feedback during long operations
- **Background Data Loading**: Optimized data loading that doesn't freeze the interface

### 3. Memory Management
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multiple data cache layers with automatic cleanup
- **Garbage Collection**: Forced memory cleanup when clearing caches
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with "‚ö° Performance" button
- **Cache Size Limits**: Automatic memory optimization for large datasets

### 4. Smart Auto-Selection
- **Intelligent Signal Selection**: Automatic selection of common signals (CO, CO2, temperature, etc.)
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple strategies to ensure at least one signal is always selected
- **Performance-Optimized Selection**: Limited auto-selection to prevent UI slowdown

### 5. Large Dataset Handling
- **File Size Detection**: Automatic optimization strategy based on file size
- **Strategic Sampling**: Representative data sampling for files with >100K rows

## üîß Usage Tips for Large Datasets

### For Best Performance:
1. **Monitor Memory**: Use "‚ö° Performance" button to track usage
2. **Clear Cache Regularly**: Use "üóëÔ∏è Clear Cache" for memory cleanup
3. **Let Auto-Selection Work**: Allow smart signal selection for faster setup
4. **Use Time Trimming**: Process smaller time ranges for very large files
5. **Trust the Sampling**: Large files are automatically optimized for plotting

### When Working with Very Large Files (>100MB):
- Files are automatically sampled to ~50K representative data points
- Original data integrity is maintained (only plotting uses samples)
- Memory usage is optimized for responsive UI
- All analysis features remain fully functional

## üöÄ Future Performance Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
- **Threaded Data Loading**: Background loading for even better responsiveness
- **Progressive Loading**: Stream large files incrementally
- **Advanced Caching**: More sophisticated cache management
- **Memory Pooling**: Optimized memory allocation strategies
