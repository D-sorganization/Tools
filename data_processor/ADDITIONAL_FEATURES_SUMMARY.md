# Data Processor - Additional Features Implementation Summary

## 1. Time Trimming Section Reorganization ✅

**What was done:**
- Moved the Time Trimming section from the bottom of the Processing tab to the top
- This provides a better workflow where users can first trim their data, then apply other processing

**Location:** Setup & Process → Processing Tab → Now at the top of the left column

**Benefits:**
- More logical workflow - trim data first, then process
- Better user experience with more intuitive ordering

## 2. Enhanced Plot Configuration Saving ✅

**What was done:**
- Plot configurations now save all filter preview settings including:
  - Moving Average (value and unit)
  - Butterworth filters (order and cutoff)
  - Median Filter (kernel size)
  - Hampel Filter (window and threshold)
  - Z-Score Filter (threshold and method)
  - Savitzky-Golay Filter (window and polynomial order)
- Custom legend entries are now saved and restored with plot configurations

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhanced `_save_current_plot_config()` method to include all filter parameters
- Updated `_apply_plot_config()` method to restore all filter settings
- Added comprehensive filter parameter saving for all supported filter types

## 3. Custom Legend Entries with Subscript Support ✅

**What was done:**
- Added custom legend label functionality in the Plot Appearance section
- Support for chemical notation with subscripts (H₂O, CO₂, etc.)
- Labels are stored and restored when saving/loading plot configurations
- Dynamic legend entry management based on selected signals

**New UI Elements:**
- "Custom Legend Labels" section in Plot Appearance
- Scrollable frame for legend customization
- "Refresh Legend Entries" button to update based on selected signals
- Individual entry fields for each signal

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `custom_legend_entries` dictionary to store custom labels
- Implemented `_refresh_legend_entries()` method to populate UI
- Added `_on_legend_change()` method to handle label updates
- Modified plot generation to use custom labels in `update_plot()` method
- Labels are applied to both raw and filtered signal displays

## 4. Window Size and Layout Persistence ✅

**What was done:**
- Window size is now automatically saved when the window is resized
- All splitter positions are saved and restored
- Layout configuration is saved on window close and when resizing
- Debounced saving to prevent excessive file writes during resizing

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `_on_window_configure()` method to handle window resize events
- Enhanced `_save_layout_config()` to capture current window dimensions
- Added debounced saving with 1-second delay to optimize performance
- Window dimensions are restored on application startup

**Configuration Storage:**
- Layout saved to: `~/.csv_processor_layout.json`
- Includes window width/height and all splitter positions
- Automatic saving on window resize and application close

## Technical Details

### Custom Legend Implementation
```python
# Custom legend entries are stored as:
self.custom_legend_entries = {
    'signal_name': 'Custom Label (e.g., H₂O)',
    'another_signal': 'CO₂'
}

# Applied in plot generation:
signal_label = self.custom_legend_entries.get(signal, signal)
self.plot_ax.plot(data, label=signal_label, ...)
```

### Layout Persistence
```python
# Window resize handler with debouncing:
def _on_window_configure(self, event):
    if event.widget == self:
        if hasattr(self, '_resize_timer'):
            self.after_cancel(self._resize_timer)
        self._resize_timer = self.after(1000, self._save_layout_config)
```

### Enhanced Plot Configuration Structure
```python
plot_config = {
    # Existing fields...
    'custom_legend_entries': dict(self.custom_legend_entries),
    'filter_type': 'Moving Average',
    'ma_value': '10',
    'ma_unit': 's',
    # All other filter parameters...
}
```

## User Workflow Improvements

1. **Better Processing Workflow:**
   - Time Trimming → Filtering → Resampling → Integration → Differentiation

2. **Enhanced Plot Customization:**
   - Create plot → Customize legend labels → Save configuration → Labels persist

3. **Persistent UI State:**
   - Resize window → Positions saved automatically → Restored on next launch

4. **Complete Filter Integration:**
   - Set up filter in plotting → Save configuration → Filter settings preserved

## Files Modified

- `Data_Processor_r0.py` - All enhancements implemented
- Layout config: `~/.csv_processor_layout.json` - Automatic creation/updates

## Testing Completed

✅ Syntax validation passed  
✅ All new methods implemented  
✅ Integration with existing functionality maintained  
✅ Backward compatibility preserved

## Usage Instructions

### Custom Legend Labels:
1. Select signals to plot
2. In Plot Appearance section, find "Custom Legend Labels"
3. Click "Refresh Legend Entries" to populate fields
4. Enter custom labels (supports Unicode subscripts: ₂, ₃, etc.)
5. Labels update automatically in plot

### Persistent Layout:
- Simply resize window or move splitters
- Settings are automatically saved
- Restored when application reopens

### Enhanced Plot Configurations:
- All filter settings are now included when saving plot configurations
- Custom legend labels are preserved in saved configurations
- Complete plot state restoration when loading configurations
