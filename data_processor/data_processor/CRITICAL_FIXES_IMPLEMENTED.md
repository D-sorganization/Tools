## ðŸ”§ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Memory Management** âœ… FIXED
**Issue**: Large files loaded entirely into memory without chunking  
**Risk**: Out of memory errors with large datasets  

**Solution Implemented**:
- **MemoryManager Class**: Added comprehensive memory management utilities
  - `get_memory_usage()`: Monitor current memory usage
  - `check_memory_available()`: Check available memory before operations
  - `force_garbage_collection()`: Force cleanup after processing
  - `estimate_dataframe_memory()`: Estimate memory requirements

- **Chunked Reading**: Implemented automatic chunking for large files
  - Files > 100MB automatically use chunked reading (10,000 rows per chunk)
  - Memory-efficient processing for CSV/TSV files
  - Automatic garbage collection after each file

- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory checks during operations
  - Warns users when memory is low
  - Prevents operations that would exceed available memory
  - Monitors memory usage during file processing

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Memory management utilities
class MemoryManager:
    @staticmethod
    def check_memory_available(min_available_mb: float = 100.0) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        # Check available memory before operations
    
    @staticmethod
    def force_garbage_collection():
        # Force cleanup after processing

# Chunked reading in DataReader
def read_file(file_path: str, format_type: str, chunk_size: Optional[int] = None, **kwargs):
    # Automatic chunking for large files
    if file_size > 100 * 1024 * 1024:  # 100MB threshold
        chunk_size = 10000  # Default chunk size
```

### 2. **Threading Safety** âœ… FIXED
**Issue**: UI updates from background threads without proper synchronization  
**Risk**: Race conditions and UI corruption  

**Solution Implemented**:
- **ThreadSafeUI Class**: Implemented thread-safe UI update mechanism
  - Queue-based UI updates from background threads
  - Proper synchronization between worker threads and main UI thread
  - Automatic cleanup on application shutdown

- **Safe UI Updates**: All background operations now use thread-safe updates
  - `thread_safe_ui.safe_update()` for all UI modifications
  - No more direct UI access from background threads
  - Proper error handling in UI update thread

- **Thread Management**: Proper thread lifecycle management
  - Daemon threads for background operations
  - Clean shutdown of UI update thread
  - Memory cleanup after thread completion

**Code Changes**:
```python
class ThreadSafeUI:
    def __init__(self, root_widget):
        self._update_queue = queue.Queue()
        self._ui_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._process_ui_updates, daemon=True)
    
    def safe_update(self, update_func):
        # Queue UI updates for safe execution in main thread

# Usage in background operations
self.thread_safe_ui.safe_update(lambda: self.converter_status_label.configure(text="Processing..."))
```

### 3. **Input Validation** âœ… FIXED
**Issue**: Insufficient validation of user inputs  
**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities and application crashes  

**Solution Implemented**:
- **InputValidator Class**: Comprehensive input validation utilities
  - `validate_file_path()`: Validate file existence and accessibility
  - `validate_directory_path()`: Validate directory existence and writability
  - `validate_file_size()`: Check file size limits
  - `validate_numeric_input()`: Validate numeric inputs with ranges
  - `sanitize_filename()`: Sanitize filenames for security

- **File Validation**: Comprehensive file validation before processing
  - File existence and accessibility checks
  - File size validation (configurable limits)
  - File format detection and validation
  - Directory permission checks

- **User Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
  - Numeric input validation with min/max ranges
  - Path validation for security
  - Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

**Code Changes**:
```python
class InputValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def validate_file_path(file_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        # Comprehensive file validation
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate_directory_path(dir_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        # Directory validation with permission checks
    
    @staticmethod
    def sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str:
        # Security-focused filename sanitization

# Usage in file operations
is_valid, error_msg = InputValidator.validate_file_path(file_path)
if not is_valid:
    # Handle validation error
```
