# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: Current vs Baseline Version

## Key Findings

### 1. Code Complexity
- **Current Version**: 6,223 lines (1,867 lines MORE than baseline)
- **Baseline Version**: 4,356 lines
- **Added Complexity**: ~43% increase in code size

### 2. Core Performance Issues Identified

#### Over-Engineering Problem
The current version has been over-optimized with:
- Complex async operations using `after()` scheduling
- Multiple caching layers (`processed_files` + `loaded_data_cache`)
- Extensive debug output and error checking
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Memory management overhead

#### Baseline Simplicity (Why it was faster)
The baseline version was fast because it was **SIMPLE**:
- Direct function execution (no async complexity)
- Simple caching with just `processed_files` dictionary
- Straightforward data loading without optimization layers
- Minimal error checking overhead

### 3. Specific Function Comparison

#### Baseline `on_plot_file_select()` (Lines: ~25)
- Direct data loading
- Simple UI updates
- No async operations
- Immediate plot update

#### Current `on_plot_file_select()` (Lines: ~109)
- Complex status updates
- Async scheduling with `after()`
- Multiple optimization checks
- Extensive debug output
- Progress indication overhead

### 4. Root Cause Analysis

**The performance optimizations actually HURT performance by:**
1. Adding execution overhead for "optimization" checks
2. Creating complex async patterns that slow down simple operations
3. Adding memory management that wasn't needed for typical file sizes
4. Multiple cache lookups instead of simple direct access

### 5. Solution Strategy

**Revert to Baseline Simplicity with Selective Improvements:**
1. Remove async complexity for plotting operations
2. Simplify data loading to baseline approach
3. Keep only essential caching (processed_files)
4. Remove excessive debug output
5. Keep UX improvements (no popups) but simplify implementation

### 6. Performance Lesson Learned

**"Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth**

The baseline was fast because it did exactly what was needed without unnecessary complexity. Our optimizations added overhead that exceeded any benefits for typical use cases.

### 7. Recommended Action

Create a "simplified" version that:
- Uses baseline plotting logic
- Keeps the UX improvements (no popups)
- Removes async complexity
- Maintains essential functionality
- Reduces code complexity by ~30%
