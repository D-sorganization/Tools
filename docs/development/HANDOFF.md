- Governing issue/epic: Night Watch scheduled pass (no governing issue)

## Objective and status

Docs compliance sweep: reconciled the development log state table with actual
merged PR and closed-issue records on GitHub. Found 29+ entries still marked
`in_review` or `in_progress` whose governing PRs had already merged (some as
recently as 2026-09-23, others as old as 2026-09-08). Marked 30 entries
`shipped` and 1 entry `parked`. The log is now current.

## Files and decisions

- `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`: 31 entries reconciled. 30 marked
  `shipped` (each with the correct PR reference); 1 (DL-#5132, calibration
  numerical recovery) marked `parked` because PR #5136 was closed without
  merge and the issue is closed. Last-audited timestamp updated to
  2026-09-23 by night-watch.
- `docs/development/HANDOFF.md`: this file, replacing the stale codex session
  HANDOFF from #5322.

## Validation

- No source code changed; only `docs/development/` files touched.
- All formerly-active entries now have accurate `shipped` or `parked` states.
- Zero `in_review` / `in_progress` entries remain.

## Blockers and risks

- DL-#5132 (calibration numerical recovery, PR #5136): PR closed without
  merge and issue closed. Marked `parked`. Retry would require a new issue
  and a new entry.
- DL-#0001 (backup-pyo3-split): pre-existing parked orphan with no governing
  issue; not changed in this pass.

## Next steps

- Open the draft PR, let CI pass, and merge.
- A future Night Watch pass should audit the older DL-00NN entries for
  candidates to move to `abandoned`.

## Change log

- `SELF` — Night Watch 2026-09-23: reconcile 31 stale development log entries
  to `shipped` or `parked` based on verified GitHub merge records.
