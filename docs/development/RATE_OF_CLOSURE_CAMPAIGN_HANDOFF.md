The `wind-strategy-analysis/v2` result distinguishes actual estimate-driven
outcomes, the same declared policy evaluated with true-wind information, and
the hindsight best result among only the declared presets. Its summaries add
failure-inclusive target-circle hold probability, empirical miss-distance
CVaR at a declared alpha, and short/long/left/right probabilities with
unconditional and conditional mean excess. Legacy regret/best aliases remain,
but the precise names are preset-oracle regret/probability; the signed
information-cost delta is not presented as EVPI.

## Launch and registration

Run both commands from the worktree root in separate PowerShell terminals:

```powershell
python src/rate_of_closure/launch_pyqt6.py
cd src/rate_of_closure/web
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5270 --strictPort
```

The web app is then at `http://127.0.0.1:5270/`. Its authoritative Vite
package is `src/rate_of_closure/web`. The React navigation ID
`launch-monitor-analytics` is declared in
`web/src/model/viewPreferences.ts`, rendered by `web/src/App.tsx`, and backed
by `web/src/components/LaunchMonitorAnalyticsPanel.tsx`. The PyQt stable tab ID
`launch_monitor_analytics` is registered in `ui/pyqt6/main_window.py` and
backed by `ui/pyqt6/launch_monitor_analytics_tab.py`.

## Verification evidence

- Full pre-v2 Python campaign suite: `740 passed, 4 skipped, 15 warnings`.
- Post-v2 wind-uncertainty plus flight/solver contract tests: `25 passed`.
- React/Vitest suite: `70` files and `439` tests passed.
- Post-v2 targeted React wind-uncertainty suite: `11 passed`.
- React production build: `tsc && vite build` passed (147 modules).
- React `type-check` and ESLint passed.
- Production Python mypy: no issues in 60 changed source files.
- Ruff and Black: 79 changed Python files passed.
- Module-size budget and `git diff --check` passed. The Flight Explorer and
  launch-monitor analytics production modules are each below 400 lines.
- The four skips are Rust parity cases because a compatible `tools_core` wheel
  is not installed. Other warnings are the existing Hypothesis pytest-plugin,
  Matplotlib legend, and Node local-storage-path warnings.
- A repository-root `npm run build` is not a valid campaign gate in this
  checkout: unrelated workspaces lack `turbo`, `next`, and other dependencies.
  The authoritative Rate of Closure package build above passes.

### Variation ensemble continuation

Issue [#4144](https://github.com/D-sorganization/Tools/issues/4144) and draft
PR [#4167](https://github.com/D-sorganization/Tools/pull/4167) own the universal
multi-trial visualization contract. The integration branch includes that work
through the investigation-suite ancestry.

- Focused Python variation suite: `120 passed` across the shared engine,
  simulation adapter, PyQt controls, complete results workspace, plots,
  linked selection, exports, and cross-runtime fixture.
- Focused React variation suite: `21 passed` across six files, including the
  every-trial arc inspector and geometry performance contract.
- Live integrated React QA at `http://127.0.0.1:5270/` ran a 200-trial
  Delivery/Impact/Flight study and a 24-trial Pendulum/Impact/Flight study.
- The pendulum run rendered `24/24` swing arcs, `36,024/36,024` vertices,
  `33/1501` quiet samples at the declared 5 mm RMS threshold, linked trial
  selection, impact/flight scatter variables, a four-variable matrix with
  marginals, sensitivity results, and `24` honest landing coordinates.
- The arc inspector exposes modeled point, outcome cohort, perturbation source,
  source quantile, phase, linked highlighted trial, reset, PNG, variability SVG,
  and versioned plot-definition export controls. Frame and alignment are shown
  as `app_frame:x_target,y_up,z_right` and common simulation time.
- The default scalar delivery study correctly reports that no geometric
  no-impact cohort exists; the pendulum result carries typed hit/no-impact/
  numerical-failure cohorts without fabricated impact or landing coordinates.

### Wedge AoA worked example continuation

Commit `cfcc99681` expands
`docs/specs/GOLF_CLUB_WEDGE_KINEMATICS.md` and pins its numeric claims in tests.
The declared 64-degree lie, 15-degree lean, 20 mm offset, 1,307 deg/s shaft
rate, and 30 mph state decomposes as follows:

- shaft-datum translation vertical speed: `-2.135647 m/s` (`91.7047%`);
- shaft-axis rotation vertical speed: `-0.193183 m/s` (`8.2953%`);
- total AoA: `-10.0000 deg`;
- no-shaft counterfactual AoA: `-9.18117 deg`;
- direct shaft contribution: `-0.81882 deg`.

The source boundary is explicit: 1,307 deg/s is Cheetham's mean for 94 tour
**driver** swings, not a claimed wedge norm. The documented sensitivity study
pins 0, 652, 1,003, 1,307, 1,611, and 2,432 deg/s. The current impact and calm
Waterloo-Penner flight chain predicts only `17.566 m` (`19.211 yd`) carry for a
30 mph, -10-degree AoA, 37-degree dynamic-loft case; the same model needs
approximately `37.887 mph` club speed to reach 30 yd. Focused wedge/flight
verification: `31 passed`; the broader post-format regression: `59 passed`.

### Current CI diagnosis

At the previous published head, PR-triggered CI run `31134083167` failed its
quality gate because Ruff 0.14.10 would reformat two files. The independently
dispatched run `31134149702` passed its quality-gate job, but that dispatch used
a narrower changed-file scope and is not replacement evidence. Commit
`282b1a4d3` applies only the two reported formatter changes. A local
PR-merge-base-equivalent gate then reported `77 files already formatted`, Ruff
clean, `59 passed`, and a clean diff. New protected checks must run on the
published continuation head; queued work is not counted as passing.

The next exact-head PR run `31135497996` confirmed the formatting fix and then
exposed CI's pinned mypy 1.13 compatibility errors across six files. Commit
`1bc7f567c` resolves those errors with typed NumPy/Qt scalar boundaries,
literal narrowing for imported target kinds and analytics selections, and
distinct correlation/coefficient variables; it does not add blanket ignores.
The PR-equivalent 58-source-file set now passes both mypy 1.13 and the local
mypy 1.15, Ruff reports `77 files already formatted`, and `189` affected-domain
tests pass. Protected CI still needs to complete on the newly published head.

### Base synchronization and file-size recovery

The PR base advanced normally through #4212 merge
`8526f7e0ea7b08f7bd48423bf2416b2a822daf56` and #4209 merge
`4b659acc1f7fc183dff60daea2553009e82dbab9`. Local merge commit
`778be95a682998b7b2f71b3d68aa60b8c6f46891` synchronizes that exact base into
the child without rebasing, retargeting, or rewriting either parent.

The merge had one conflict in `flight_explorer_tab.py`: the child had already
split the shared speed-unit table into `flight_explorer_controls.py`, while the
parent still referenced its former local constant. Resolution retains the
child's extracted canonical table and typed Qt scalar locals, together with the
parent's Launch Direction/analytics contracts. The analytics handoff and its
expanded TypeScript parity test merged without conflict.

Failed File Size Budget run `31136702822`, job `92737550769`, reported three
files against the old base: `simulation_tab.py` at 774 LOC,
`plotting/catalog.py` at 533 LOC, and `main_window.py` at 521 LOC. After the
normal parent merges, the exact changed-only gate proved that the latter two
were base-owned and left only `simulation_tab.py` as a child violation. Commit
`50089b66a3eca3220d157dded040cc74d02c729a` separates controls and runtime
behavior without changing the public `SimulationTab` API. Final formatted
sizes are 402, 218, and 272 LOC respectively.

Exact post-sync evidence against
`origin/feat/4181-launch-monitor-registry@4b659acc1`:

- CI-equivalent changed-only 500-LOC check: 55 files scanned, zero violations.
- Repository module-size budget and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Mypy 1.13.0: 44 changed production files passed.
- Ruff 0.14.10 check/format: 59 changed Python files passed and already formatted.
- High-risk PyQt simulation/navigation suite: 135 passed.
- Shared flight/solver plus flight, playback, analytics, and help suite:
  230 passed, four expected Rust parity skips.
- Complete React suite: 70 files and 445 tests passed; TypeScript type-check,
  zero-warning ESLint, and the 147-module production build passed.

## Open release blockers

GitHub issue #4201 remains open. Its 2026-08-06 release checkpoint still
requires all of the following before any production-ready or merge claim:

- protected CI and required reviews for the combined stack;
- complete PyQt/React end-user workflows for spatial targets, desired-flight
  solving, solution families, capability profiles, and wind uncertainty;
- off-main-thread wind-ensemble execution with progress and cancellation;
- complete save/load/export integration;
- Rust/WASM trajectory parity and installed-package/UpstreamDrift pin checks;
- scientific validation, convergence, performance, and benchmark evidence;
- browser resize, high-DPI, keyboard, accessibility, reduced-motion, and visual
  regression coverage.

The metric catalog, inverse solver, solution families, capability optimizer,
spatial target, and wind-uncertainty work must therefore be described as tested
contracts/cores unless and until their missing UI workflows are delivered.

## Next safe steps

1. Publish this child continuation only through a normal push after review,
   then require protected checks on that exact head; do not retarget,
   force-push, admin-merge, or bypass protected checks.
2. Keep epic #4218 and children #4219-#4225 sequenced after this
   ball-flight/variation/wedge campaign reaches its declared completion gate.
   The top-toolstrip/persistence work must not be used to hide #4217 release
   blockers or intermixed with this recovery diff.
3. Add the missing UI workflows against the canonical shared Python/TypeScript
   contracts, with one visible-control-to-state integration test per control.
4. Add cancellation/progress, persistence/export migrations, Rust/WASM golden
   parity, performance budgets, and Playwright visual/accessibility coverage.
5. Verify a clean installed package and the exact UpstreamDrift dependency pin.
6. Rerun every recorded gate, inspect protected GitHub checks/reviews, and keep
   #4201 open until every acceptance criterion has current evidence.
