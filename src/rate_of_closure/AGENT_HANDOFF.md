## 2026-08-05 Wedge Impact Inspector Integration

Branch `feat/4163-impact-inspector` integrates the draft variation branch with
the shared golf-club stack through wedge kinematics PR #4172. It adds the first
bounded implementation slice for wedge epic #4158 / impact-inspector issue
#4163:

- Canonical inspection time and event label on every `SimulationRun`: impact
  for hits, closest approach for misses.
- Exact `Jump to Impact` / `Jump to Closest Approach` controls in PyQt6 and
  React, with playback paused before the jump.
- `simulation/impact_kinematics.py`, which adapts retained pose/twist/contact
  data to `shared.python.golf_club.WedgeKinematicState` and preserves geometry
  provenance and model limitations.
- Engineering readouts in both clients for contact/reference AoA, remove-shaft
  counterfactual, shaft rotation and vertical velocity, face-normal rate,
  leading-edge/arc rate where available, and screw-axis distance.
- Restored manual angular velocity in the React simulation path; the previous
  hard-coded zero made all closure and shaft metrics false zeros.
- Deterministic midpoint tie-breaking for a flat maximum-speed plateau, so the
  manual source's automatic event is its documented square pose at 30 ms.

Physics boundary: articulated pendulum runs expose the measured wrist-to-head
shaft line but have no shaft-twist degree of freedom. The inspector reports
that absence rather than inventing torsional motion. The web mirror still does
not retain full head pose; its readout declares that limitation until WASM or a
canonical backend replaces the temporary TypeScript mirror.

Focused evidence before the first push: 35 Python/PyQt tests, 35 React/model
tests, Ruff, TypeScript, ESLint, and Vite production build passed. Browser QA
verified the 1,307 deg/s manual fixture and a 1.430 s closest-approach miss with
zero console warnings/errors. Native-window QA confirmed the control and
readout are visible in the standalone PyQt6 app.

## Status Note

`src/rate_of_closure` and `src/shared/python/swing_sim` do **not exist on
`main` yet** — they land with PR #4119. This doc describes the tool as it
exists on the in-flight branch stack (`feat/impact-simulation-platform` →
`feat/investigation-suite` → `feat/course-showcase`) so the next agent has
full context the moment #4119 merges. If you're reading this on a fresh
`main` checkout and don't see `src/rate_of_closure/`, check out one of those
branches or wait for #4119 to land.

## Where This Tool Is Headed

Rate of Closure started as a single-page "closure rate" calculator (twist
model: GC-path vs impact-point-path gap, °/ft). Epics #4103 → #4120 → #4125 →
#4130 are growing it into a full swing → impact → ball-flight simulator with
PyQt6 + web parity and eventual public GitHub Pages distribution. Read
`src/rate_of_closure/README.md` (frame conventions, Cheetham dossier sourcing,
run instructions) before touching physics code.

## The #4119 → #4124 → #4129 PR Stack

Each PR consolidates a whole epic's stacked feature branches into one PR to
keep self-hosted CI load down (see `CLAUDE.md` — these are big diffs).

- **#4119** `feat/impact-simulation-platform` (epic #4103, open, auto-merge
  armed). Base tool (twist model, PyQt6 + React/Vite web, Cheetham dossier
  data) + STL clubheads/club library/inertial model + `swing_sim` shared
  package (`src/shared/python/swing_sim/`: swing sources, impact model ported
  from UpstreamDrift with 3 physics fixes, gear effect, 7 literature
  ball-flight models, goal-driven multi-start solver) + `swing-core` Rust
  crate (pyo3 + wasm) + app integration (simulation session, impact-time
  scrubber, screw-axis overlay via the rotation_converter adapter, video
  controls, CSV/JSON export, solver panel). 404 pytest + 72 vitest + 111
  cargo tests, all local gates green. Supersedes #4092/#4097/#4098/#4112-4118.

- **#4124** `feat/investigation-suite` (epic #4120, open, **draft state —
  do not merge yet**, stacked on #4119). Adds `rate_of_closure/plotting/`
  (40-variable data catalog, `PlotSpec`, Plots tab + custom-plot wizard),
  scale-separated Strike/Swing/Flight viewers + standalone Flight Explorer,
  `swing_sim/variation/` (seeded Monte Carlo/NoiseSpec engine, dispersion +
  Spearman sensitivity, Variation tab), and V4: glossary (60 terms),
  cold-user help system, "Derivation & Traceability" → "Calculation
  Description" rename, full-model derivations, hover-hint completeness sweep.
  Supersedes draft PRs #4121/#4122/#4123. 566 pytest + 125 vitest passing.

- **#4129** `feat/course-showcase` (epic #4125, open, **draft state — do
  not merge yet**, stacked on #4124). Merges `feat/realistic-heads` (H1:
  parametric club-type geometry, volumetric COG via divergence theorem),
  `feat/swing-kinetics` (H2: joint torque/force plots + 3D overlays from
  pendulum inverse dynamics), `feat/putting-vertical` (H3: `swing_sim`
  putting module + app Putting tab), then adds on top: H7 course scene
  (`ui/course.py` / `course_scene.py`) + target optimization
  (`swing_sim/solver/targets.py`, `TargetRegion`, `ImpactGoal.target_region`),
  and H6 showcase styling (`ui/pyqt6/app_style.py`, UpstreamDrift launcher
  visual language) + yards-default distance units. 413 pytest + 309 swing_sim
  - 174 vitest passing. H4 (AffineDrift putting research content) and H5
    (public release-management repo) are cross-repo and tracked in #4125
    directly, not in this PR.

**Do not merge #4124 or #4129 before their base merges** — SPEC.md sections
were unioned assuming sequential merge order; merging out of order will
produce conflicting/duplicate changelog rows.

## swing_sim Packages

`src/shared/python/swing_sim/` (introduced by #4119, home for physics shared
with UpstreamDrift via the established shared-module arrow):

- `swing_sim/flight/` — 7 literature ball-flight models (drag/lift/spin
  decay), citations in registry metadata.
- `swing_sim/impact/` — impact model ported from UpstreamDrift (offset-drop
  fix, opt-in 3×3 MOI tensor, inverted friction spin axis fix), gear effect,
  `SpringDamperImpactModel` (Kelvin-Voigt contact force history, 1e-7s steps)
  — this is the contact-force law epic #4130 will extend for the full
  contact-interval integration rather than duplicate.
- `swing_sim/solver/` — goal-driven multi-start least-squares solver;
  `targets.py` (added in #4129) adds `TargetRegion` for green/fairway
  optimization goals.
- `swing_sim/variation/` (added in #4124) — namespaced variable registry,
  `NoiseSpec`/`VariationPlan`, seeded parallel N-run Monte Carlo engine,
  dispersion/OAT sensitivity/Spearman/landing-ellipse stats.

Epic #4130 (Impact-Interval Club Dynamics) will add `impact_interval/` to
this same package — its home is explicitly `swing_sim` so UpstreamDrift
reaches it via vendor, per that epic's F2 phase description. Not started yet
(foundation-only epic, no PR).

## How #4103/#4120/#4125/#4130 Relate to This Tool

All four are rate_of_closure epics specifically (unlike the wider-monorepo
epics tracked in the root `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, e.g. SCADA #4085-#4089).
#4103 is the foundation platform; #4120, #4125 are sequential feature waves
stacked directly on its PR; #4130 is a physics-depth epic that extends the
impact model #4103 introduced (contact-interval integration replacing the
instantaneous-impulse approximation) — foundation phase only so far.

## Web Mirror + GitHub Pages

The web mirror (`src/rate_of_closure/web/`, React/Vite/TS) is pinned
test-for-test against the PyQt6 model today (TS mirrors hand-written, not yet
WASM — that swap is explicitly deferred to Phase 7 of #4103). It builds to a
static bundle (`npm run build`) and carries Tauri scripts for desktop
packaging, same as other web tools in the repo.

**There is no automated GitHub Pages CI deploy for this tool yet.** No
`.github/workflows/*.yml` references `rate_of_closure` or Pages deploy
actions as of this writing. The only Pages-publishing precedent in the repo
is `src/web_applications/unit_converter/unit-converter-app/DEPLOYMENT.md`'s
manual branch-folder publish (Settings → Pages → select branch/folder).
Phase 7 of #4103 ("GitHub Pages mirror updated (public share link), parity
tests as deploy gates") owns building a real workflow — do not improvise one
in an unrelated PR.

## Must-Read Architecture Pointers

1. `src/rate_of_closure/README.md` — frame conventions, unit conventions,
   dossier sourcing, run/build instructions.
2. `src/rate_of_closure/model.py` (base twist physics, no Qt) once #4119
   lands.
3. `src/shared/python/swing_sim/impact/` — the contact-force law shared
   with (and about to be extended by) epic #4130.
4. `rust_core/swing-core/` — pendulum EOM + plane projection, pyo3 + wasm
   targets, follows the `tools-core` feature-contract pattern.
5. `.github/workflows/maturin-swing-core.yml` (added by #4119) — Rust wheel
   build for this crate.

## Gate Commands (this tool)

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/rate_of_closure src/shared/python/swing_sim -n auto --timeout=60
cd src/rate_of_closure/web && npm run test && npm run build && npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint .
cargo test -p swing-core
python3 -m ruff check src/rate_of_closure src/shared/python/swing_sim
python3 -m mypy src/rate_of_closure src/shared/python/swing_sim
```

## Do-Not List

- Do not duplicate the Kelvin-Voigt contact-force law — #4130 requires
  `SpringDamperImpactModel` and the new `impact_interval/` package to share
  one implementation (DRY, explicit in the epic's binding standards).
- Do not exceed 500 LOC per file in `rate_of_closure`, `swing_sim`, or
  `swing-core` — sub-package instead.
- Do not hand-mirror physics into the TS web layer once WASM lands (Phase 7)
  — that's the whole point of the wasm-pack build; today's hand-written TS
  mirrors are a stopgap, not the target architecture.
- Do not merge the stacked PRs out of order (see stack section above).
- Do not invent citations in derivation docstrings or the AffineDrift
  putting research content (H4) — sourced/verifiable only, dossier
  discipline per epic #4125.

## Roadmap (ordered)

1. Merge #4119, then #4124, then #4129 in order.
2. Start epic #4130 Phase F1 (formulation document) — six-DOF rigid-club
   contact-interval derivation, validation program design.
3. Phase 7 of #4103: WASM swap + real Pages CI deploy workflow.
4. #4125 H4/H5: AffineDrift putting research content and the public
   release-management repo (both cross-repo, not started).
