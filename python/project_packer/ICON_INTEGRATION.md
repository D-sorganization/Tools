# Folder Packer Tool - Windows Icon & Taskbar Integration

## Recent Improvements

### Version 1.1 - Enhanced Windows Integration

**Icon & Taskbar Support:**
- ✅ Proper ICO file loading for crisp icons at all sizes
- ✅ Multiple icon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64) for better scaling
- ✅ Windows taskbar icon integration using `iconbitmap()`
- ✅ Windows App User Model ID for proper taskbar grouping
- ✅ Application manifest for Windows visual styles
- ✅ Fallback support for JPG icons if ICO not available

**Technical Details:**
- Uses both `iconbitmap()` and `iconphoto()` for maximum compatibility
- Sets Windows App User Model ID early in startup for proper taskbar behavior
- Includes Windows manifest for DPI awareness and modern controls
- Icon files are embedded in the executable via PyInstaller

**Files Included:**
- `folder_icon.ico` - Primary icon file (Windows format)
- `folder_icon.jpg` - Fallback icon file
- `FolderPacker.exe.manifest` - Windows application manifest
- `FolderPacker.spec` - PyInstaller build configuration

**Build Process:**
1. Icon files are automatically included in the executable
2. Manifest is embedded for proper Windows integration
3. App User Model ID is set for taskbar grouping
4. Multiple icon sizes are generated for optimal display

**Usage:**
Simply run `FolderPacker.exe` - the icon will appear properly in both the window title bar and the Windows taskbar.

## Icon Sources
- Original icon files should be in the same directory as the source code
- The executable will automatically use the embedded icons
- Icons support both light and dark Windows themes

## Building from Source
Run: `pyinstaller FolderPacker.spec`

The spec file includes all necessary configuration for proper icon integration.
